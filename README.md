Hi there, fellow coder! This is a beginner-friendly resource for people like you, and you, and you (no, not you Steve)!

This repository is full of helpful links for people who are just learning to code! 

Below you'll find everything you need on how to contribute to this very same list. 

Either if this is your first time coding, or you're a veteran keyboard ninja who just wants to explore and help out, this is the place for you.

# Resources

[The current web page we will be adding to](https://glasgowcodercollective.github.io/resources/)  
I'm borrowing a lot from github docs for this writeup.

## Fork the repo

Fork this repository with the Fork button on the top right of this very same page.

You should now have a copy under your name, something like <i>yourname/resources</i>

## Create a local clone of your fork

Navigate to your own fork of this project.
Select the green "Clone or download" button, and on the dropdown that shows up copy the url that ends with <i>.git</i>.

On your terminal, type the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/yourname/resources.git`

Now, change the directory to your project:
`cd resources`

## Set an upstream pointing to the original project

`git remote add upstream https://github.com/GlasgowCoderCollective/resources.git`

You can check if the remotes are set correctly with:
`git remote -v`

It should print out something like this:

```output
origin https://github.com/yourname/resources.git (fetch)
origin https://github.com/yourname/resources.git (push)
upstream https://github.com/GlasgowCoderCollective/resources.git (fetch)
upstream https://github.com/GlasgowCoderCollective/resources.git (push)
```

## Check for changes

You should check regularly to see if there's any changes in the original code by fetching them
`git fetch upstream`

Checkout your fork's local master branch
`git checkout master`

Merge any changes from upstream/master to your local master branch.
`git merge upstream/master`

## In your code editor

Make changes in the index.html file adding your link to some helpful resource, copying the entire links div and editing to include the url and some descriptor.
Save any changes

## Back in command line

## Add and commit

`git add index.html`

Now make a commit
`git commit -m "add my link"`

At this point you've got your changes on your local copy of the code (on your computer) and you've told git about it by adding and committing.
Next you want to push the changes up to your remote copy (your fork on github)

It's a good idea to redo the check for changes section to include anything and avoid problems

## Pushing to your remote

`git push origin master`

your code should now be pushed to your remote.

## To do a pull request

In github in your fork, refresh if it was still open

Select the "new pull request" button
