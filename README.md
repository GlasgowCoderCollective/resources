# resources
I'm borrowing a lot from github docs for this writeup

## Fork the repo
Fork this repository with the Fork button on top right of screen

You should now have a copy under your name ie yourname/resources

## Create a local clone of your fork
Navigate to your fork of the project
Select the dropdown on the green clone or download button and copy the url


In command line type the url:
git clone https://github.com/yourname/resources.git


Change directory into your project:
cd resources


## Set an upstream pointing to the original project
git add upstream https://github.com/GlasgowCoderCollective/resources.git


You can check the remotes are set correctly with:

``git remote -v``

It should print something like this:
origin  https://github.com/yourname/resources.git (fetch)

origin  https://github.com/yourname/resources.git (push)

upstream        https://github.com/GlasgowCoderCollective/resources.git (fetch)

upstream        https://github.com/GlasgowCoderCollective/resources.git (push)

## Check for changes

   You should check regularly to see if there's any changes in the original code by fetching them
 git fetch upstream

 Checkout your fork's local master branch

 ``git checkout master``


 Merge any changes from upstream/master to your local master branch.
 
 ``git merge upstream/master``

## In your code editor

 Make changes in the index.html file adding your link to some helpful resource, copying the entire links div and editing to include the url and some descriptor.
 
 Save any changes


 ## Back in command line:
 
 ### Add and commit
 
`` git add index.html``

 Now make a commit
 
 ``git commit -m "add my link"``

 At this point you've got your changes on your local copy of the code (on your computer) and you've told git about it by adding and committing.
 
 Next you want to push the changes up to your remote copy (your fork on github) 

It's a good idea to redo the check for changes section to include anything and avoid problems

## pushing to your remote

``git push origin master``

your code should now be pushed to your remote.  

## To do a pull request 

In github in your fork, refresh if it was still open

Select the ``new pull request`` button
